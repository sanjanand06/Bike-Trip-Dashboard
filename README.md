# Bike-Trip-Dashboard
Analysis on bike trip data to find out how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently

### Background
Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to
any other station in the system anytime.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who
purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The director, Lily Moreno, has a clearly set goal to convert casual riders into annual members. In order to do
that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.

### Business Task

### Analysis
- Usage (based on trip duration) of bikes by casual riders is almost twice that of member riders.
- Casual customers use bikeshare services more during weekends, while members use them consistently over the entire week.
- Average trip duration of casual riders is more than twice that of member rider over any given day of the week cumulatively.
- Casual riders prefer electric bikes the most while classic bikes are popular among members.

### Recommendations
- Make use of discounts to make sure casual riders use the bikes consistently over the week.
- Make sure to give discounts for first time membership to casual riders to increase conversion.
